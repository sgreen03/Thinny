  I am a recent computer engineering graduate from the Unviersity of Guelph. I enjoy solving problems and tackling difficult challenges. I discovered my passion for coding in high school and I have become proficient in many languages including Java, C, Python and VB.
  
  I am fascinated by how the world works and I am driven towards building a better future. I feel that technology is what will drive us forward. I have interests in the areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
